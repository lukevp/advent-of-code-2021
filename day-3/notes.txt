For part 1,
 - basically it's doing an even/odd check on each digit. we just need to iterate the file and accumulate each into a slot the length of the first input
 - (assuming input is a matrix).
 Then the result is whatever the even/odd is for each digit.


 Challenges:
 - i didn't remember the syntax for iterating the offset + value at the same time in TypeScript
 - I didn't remember how to initialize a 2d array to all 0s ()
 
 Final: My assumption was wrong about even/odd, it really needed to determine a pivot point of the center of the 0/1 space.

 For part 2,
 Assumptions:
  - you have to iterate the whole bit strings once first to get the most/least common bit for each position.
