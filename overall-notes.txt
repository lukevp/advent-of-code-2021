I did day 1 part 2 (sliding window) by loading the whole thing into memory.  I should try again with using a buffer of the window size.

 Challenges:
 - i didn't remember the syntax for iterating the offset + value at the same time in TypeScript
 - I didn't remember how to initialize a 2d array to all 0s (new Array(5).fill(0))
